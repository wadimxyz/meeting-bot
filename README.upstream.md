## 📖 Usage

### How Meeting Bot Works

Meeting Bot operates with a single job execution model to ensure reliable meeting processing:

- **Single Job Processing**: Meeting Bot accepts only one job at a time and works until it's completely finished before accepting another job
- **Automatic Retry**: The bot automatically retries on certain errors such as automation failures or when it takes too long to admit the bot into a meeting

### API Endpoints


#### Join a Google Meet
```bash
POST /google/join
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bearerToken": "your-auth-token",
  "url": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  "name": "Meeting Notetaker",
  "teamId": "team123",
  "timezone": "UTC",
  "userId": "user123",
  "botId": "UUID"
}
```

For Google Meet, you can optionally connect to an already-running Chrome via `GOOGLE_CHROME_CDP_URL`, or run the browser with a dedicated signed-in Google profile by setting `GOOGLE_CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR` or `GOOGLE_CHROME_STORAGE_STATE_PATH`. The CDP option is useful when the Docker browser is treated differently from a normal Chrome. If you use CDP, launch that Chrome with `--auto-accept-this-tab-capture` so recording can select the current Meet tab without a manual browser prompt. The Chrome window and virtual display should normally use `1280,800`; the bot then sets the page viewport to `1280x720`, leaving room for Chrome's top UI without clipping the Meet controls.

For Kubernetes, run Chrome as a sidecar container in the same pod and point `GOOGLE_CHROME_CDP_URL` at `http://127.0.0.1:9222`. The included `Dockerfile.chrome-cdp` builds a minimal Google Chrome + Xvfb CDP backend for that setup.

For **local testing**, `docker compose up --build` starts the `chrome-cdp` sidecar alongside the bot and wires `GOOGLE_CHROME_CDP_URL` to it automatically (via the sidecar's nginx proxy on `9223`, which rewrites the `Host` header so cross-container CDP works). If host port `6379` is already taken by another local Redis, start with `REDIS_PORT_HOST=6380 docker compose up --build`. Join a Meet that allows guests, make sure a second participant is present (the bot leaves if it's alone), then `POST /google/join` (see above) and follow `docker compose logs -f meeting-bot`. The recording **upload will fail** without configured storage credentials — that's expected; the join and recording are what this exercises. Set `GOOGLE_CHROME_CDP_URL=` (empty) to fall back to the bot's in-container Chromium. This sidecar joins as an anonymous guest; meetings that require sign-in need a signed-in profile (`GOOGLE_CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR`/`GOOGLE_CHROME_STORAGE_STATE_PATH`), not yet wired into the local compose.

#### Join a Microsoft Teams Meeting
```bash
POST /microsoft/join
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bearerToken": "your-auth-token",
  "url": "https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/...",
  "name": "Meeting Notetaker",
  "teamId": "team123",
  "timezone": "UTC",
  "userId": "user123",
  "botId": "UUID"
}
```

#### Join a Zoom Meeting
```bash
POST /zoom/join
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bearerToken": "your-auth-token",
  "url": "https://zoom.us/j/123456789",
  "name": "Meeting Notetaker",
  "teamId": "team123",
  "timezone": "UTC",
  "userId": "user123",
  "botId": "UUID"
}
```

### Recording Completion Notifications (Optional)

You can configure Meeting Bot to notify external systems when a recording has finished and is ready. Two channels are supported:

- Webhook HTTP POST
- Redis list push (RPUSH) to a configurable DB and list

Webhook notifications are disabled by default. Redis completion notifications are enabled automatically for Redis-worker mode (`REDIS_CONSUMER_ENABLED=true`) and can also be enabled explicitly with `NOTIFY_REDIS_ENABLED=true`.

#### Environment Variables

- NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_ENABLED: Enable webhook delivery (default: false)
- NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL: Webhook endpoint URL
- NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Optional secret to HMAC-SHA256 sign payloads. Signature header: X-Webhook-Signature

- NOTIFY_REDIS_ENABLED: Enable Redis notifications. Completion notifications are also enabled automatically when REDIS_CONSUMER_ENABLED=true so Redis jobs produce result-list entries.
- NOTIFY_REDIS_URI: Optional Redis URI for notifications; if not set, falls back to REDIS_HOST/REDIS_PORT/etc via redisUri
- NOTIFY_REDIS_DB: Optional Redis database number to use for notifications. If not set, the Redis client's default DB is used. DB 0 is allowed when explicitly configured.
- NOTIFY_REDIS_LIST: Redis list key to RPUSH to (default: jobs:meetbot:recordings)
- NOTIFY_REDIS_FAILURE_LIST: Redis list key to RPUSH failed meeting jobs to (default: jobs:meetbot:failures)

Existing REDIS_* connection envs are used to derive a default redisUri when NOTIFY_REDIS_URI is not specified.

#### Payload Schema

An example JSON payload sent via webhook and pushed to the Redis list:

```
{
  "recordingId": "abc123",
  "meetingLink": "https://your.meeting/provider/link",
  "status": "completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-08T12:00:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "userId": "user123",
    "teamId": "team123",
    "botId": "bot-uuid",
    "contentType": "video/webm",
    "uploaderType": "s3",
    "storage": {
      "provider": "s3",
      "bucket": "my-bucket",
      "key": "meeting-bot/user123/2025-09-08-12-00-00.webm",
      "region": "eu-central-1",
      "endpoint": "https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com",
      "forcePathStyle": false,
      "url": "https://my-bucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/meeting-bot/user123/2025-09-08-12-00-00.webm"
    }
  },
  "blobUrl": "https://my-bucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/meeting-bot/user123/2025-09-08-12-00-00.webm"
}
```

Notes:
- The storage URL is provided as blobUrl to be storage-provider agnostic (works for S3, Azure Blob, etc.). It may be omitted if not available.
- If available from internal APIs (screenapp uploader), a direct file URL is used. For S3-compatible uploads, the URL is constructed based on S3 configuration. For Azure Blob Storage, notification URLs are SAS URLs; unsigned Azure public blob URLs are not pushed to Redis as a fallback.
- If a webhook secret is configured, the request body is signed with HMAC-SHA256 and sent in the X-Webhook-Signature header.
- The metadata.storage section includes provider-specific path details. For S3-compatible uploads: bucket and key are provided. For the Screenapp uploader, you may see `{ provider: "screenapp", fileId, url, defaultProfile }`.

#### Behavior

- Notifications are triggered only after the recording upload/processing has successfully completed.
- Failed meeting jobs are pushed to NOTIFY_REDIS_FAILURE_LIST after all join/recording retries are exhausted, or after a non-retryable upload failure.
- Failure notifications are Redis-only and use the same NOTIFY_REDIS_ENABLED, NOTIFY_REDIS_URI, and NOTIFY_REDIS_DB settings.
- If both channels are enabled, both will receive the payload.
- Failures to notify are logged but do not interrupt the main recording flow.

#### Check System Status
```bash
GET /isbusy
```

#### Get Metrics
```bash
GET /metrics
```


### Response Format

**Success Response (202 Accepted):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Meeting join request accepted and processing started",
  "data": {
    "userId": "user123",
    "teamId": "team123",
    "status": "processing"
  }
}
```

**Busy Response (409 Conflict):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "System is currently busy processing another meeting",
  "error": "BUSY"
}
```


### Redis Message Queue (Alternative to REST API)

Meeting Bot also supports adding meeting join requests via Redis message queue, which provides asynchronous processing and better scalability for high-throughput scenarios.

#### Redis Message Structure

```typescript
interface MeetingJoinRedisParams {
  url: string;
  name: string;
  teamId: string;
  userId: string;
  bearerToken: string;
  timezone: string;
  botId?: string;
  eventId?: string;
  provider: 'google' | 'microsoft' | 'zoom';  // Required for Redis
}
```

#### Adding Messages to Redis Queue

**Using RPUSH (Recommended):**
```bash
# Connect to Redis and add a message to the queue
redis-cli RPUSH jobs:meetbot:list '{
  "url": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  "name": "Meeting Notetaker",
  "teamId": "team123",
  "timezone": "UTC",
  "userId": "user123",
  "botId": "UUID",
  "provider": "google",
  "bearerToken": "your-auth-token"
}'
```

**Using Redis Client Libraries:**

**Node.js (ioredis):**
```javascript
import Redis from 'ioredis';

const redis = new Redis({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 6379,
  password: 'your-password'
});

const message = {
  url: "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  name: "Meeting Notetaker",
  teamId: "team123",
  timezone: "UTC",
  userId: "user123",
  botId: "UUID",
  provider: "google",
  bearerToken: "your-auth-token"
};

await redis.rpush('jobs:meetbot:list', JSON.stringify(message));
```

**Python (redis-py):**
```python
import redis
import json

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, password='your-password')

message = {
    "url": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
    "name": "Meeting Notetaker",
    "teamId": "team123",
    "timezone": "UTC",
    "userId": "user123",
    "botId": "UUID",
    "provider": "google",
    "bearerToken": "your-auth-token"
}

r.rpush('jobs:meetbot:list', json.dumps(message))
```

#### Queue Processing

- **FIFO Queue**: Messages are processed in First-In-First-Out order
- **Atomic Processing Move**: The bot uses `BLMOVE` to move messages from the pending queue into the processing queue before recording starts
- **Processing Acknowledgement**: The bot removes the original message from the processing queue with `LREM` after the recording finishes or permanently fails
- **Automatic Processing**: Messages are automatically picked up and processed by the Redis consumer service
- **Single Job Execution**: Only one meeting is processed at a time across the entire system

#### Redis Configuration

The following environment variables configure Redis connectivity:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `REDIS_HOST` | Redis server hostname | `redis` |
| `REDIS_PORT` | Redis server port | `6379` |
| `REDIS_USERNAME` | Redis username (optional) | - |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | Redis password (optional) | - |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_NAME` | Queue name for meeting jobs | `jobs:meetbot:list` |
| `REDIS_PROCESSING_QUEUE_NAME` | Queue name for active Redis meeting jobs | `jobs:meetbot:processing` |
| `REDIS_CONSUMER_ENABLED` | Enable/disable Redis consumer service | `false` |

**Note**: When `REDIS_CONSUMER_ENABLED` is set to `false`, the Redis consumer service will not start, and the application will only support REST API endpoints for meeting requests. Redis message queue functionality will be disabled.

### Recording Upload Configuration

Meeting Bot automatically uploads the meeting recording to object storage when a meeting ends. You can choose between S3-compatible storage and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage at runtime using a configuration flag.

- **AWS S3** - Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service
- **GCP Cloud Storage** - Google Cloud Platform S3-compatible storage
- **MinIO** - Self-hosted S3-compatible object storage
- **Other S3-compatible services** - Any service that implements the S3 API
- **Azure Blob Storage** - Native Azure object storage

#### Storage Provider Selection

Select the storage backend without code changes:

```bash
# s3 (default) or azure
STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3
```

When `STORAGE_PROVIDER` is not set, it defaults to `s3` to preserve backward compatibility.

#### Environment Variables for S3-Compatible Upload Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | S3-compatible service endpoint URL | - | Yes for non-AWS |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Access key for bucket authentication | - | Yes |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Secret key for bucket authentication | - | Yes |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | Target bucket name for uploads | - | Yes |
| `S3_REGION` | AWS region (for AWS S3) | - | Yes |
| `S3_USE_MINIO_COMPATIBILITY` | Enable MinIO compatibility mode | `false` | No |

#### Configuration Examples

**AWS S3:**
```bash
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
S3_BUCKET_NAME=meeting-recordings
S3_REGION=us-west-2
```

**Google Cloud Storage (S3-compatible):**
```bash
S3_ENDPOINT=https://storage.googleapis.com
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-gcp-access-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-gcp-secret-key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=meeting-recordings
S3_REGION=us-west1
```

**MinIO:**
```bash
S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
S3_BUCKET_NAME=meeting-recordings
S3_REGION=us-west-2
S3_USE_MINIO_COMPATIBILITY=true
```

#### Azure Blob Storage Configuration

If you prefer Azure Blob Storage, set `STORAGE_PROVIDER=azure` and configure one of the supported authentication methods below. The bot will preserve the same folder structure and naming used by S3.

Required:

- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER` — Target container name
- One of the following auth options:
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` + `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` + `AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN` (starts with `?sv=`)
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` + `AZURE_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=true` (requires appropriate RBAC on the container)

Optional:

- `AZURE_SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS` — Expiry for generated SAS URLs (default: `3600`)
- `AZURE_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY` — Parallelism for uploads (default: `4`)
- `AZURE_BLOB_PREFIX` — Optional prefix path within the container (defaults to none; the bot already includes a `meeting-bot/...` path in object keys)

Examples

Connection string:

```bash
STORAGE_PROVIDER=azure
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=example;AccountKey=redacted;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=meeting-recordings
```

Account + Key:

```bash
STORAGE_PROVIDER=azure
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=example
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=redacted
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=meeting-recordings
```

Managed Identity (AAD):

```bash
STORAGE_PROVIDER=azure
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=example
AZURE_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=true
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=meeting-recordings
```

#### How Upload Works

1. **Automatic Upload**: When a meeting recording completes, the bot automatically uploads the file to the configured object storage (S3-compatible or Azure Blob)
2. **File Naming**: Recordings are uploaded with descriptive names including meeting details and timestamps
3. **Error Handling**: If upload fails, the bot will automatically retry upload
4. **Cleanup**: Local recording files are cleaned up after successful upload

Notes:

- The default object key layout is: `meeting-bot/{userId}/{fileName}{extension}` (e.g., `meeting-bot/1234/My Meeting - 2025-11-13 14-42.webm`). This same layout is used for both S3 and Azure to ensure parity.
- When `STORAGE_PROVIDER=azure` is set and Azure environment variables are provided, the upload will go to Azure Blob Storage instead of S3.
- Signed URL generation for Azure uses SAS tokens with a configurable TTL via `AZURE_SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS`. Redis completion notifications use these SAS URLs for Azure `blobUrl` and `metadata.storage.url`.

### Docker Configuration

The project includes Docker support with separate configurations for development and production:

- `Dockerfile.development` - Development build
- `Dockerfile.production` - Optimized production build
- `Dockerfile.chrome-cdp` - Google Chrome CDP backend for Kubernetes sidecar deployments
- `docker-compose.yml` - Complete development environment

#### Google Meet Chrome CDP Sidecar

Build and publish the Chrome backend image separately from the bot image:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.chrome-cdp -t ghcr.io/your-org/meeting-bot-chrome-cdp:latest .
docker push ghcr.io/your-org/meeting-bot-chrome-cdp:latest
```

Then run it as a sidecar in the same Kubernetes pod as the bot:

```yaml
containers:
  - name: meeting-bot
    image: ghcr.io/your-org/meeting-bot:latest
    env:
      - name: GOOGLE_CHROME_CDP_URL
        value: http://127.0.0.1:9222

  - name: chrome-cdp
    image: ghcr.io/your-org/meeting-bot-chrome-cdp:latest
    ports:
      - name: cdp
        containerPort: 9222
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 1Gi
      limits:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: 3Gi
```

Do not expose the CDP port through a Kubernetes Service or Ingress. Keep it local to the pod so only the bot container can control the browser.

#### Using Docker Image from GitHub Packages

The project automatically builds and publishes Docker images to GitHub Packages on every push to the main branch.

**Pull the latest image:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/screenappai/meeting-bot:latest
```

**Run the container:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name meeting-bot \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e MAX_RECORDING_DURATION_MINUTES=60 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e REDIS_CONSUMER_ENABLED=false \
  -e S3_ENDPOINT= \
  -e S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID= \
  -e S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= \
  -e S3_BUCKET_NAME= \
  -e S3_REGION= \
  ghcr.io/screenappai/meeting-bot:latest
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

### Meeting Join Requirements

Meeting Bot supports joining meetings where users can join with a direct link without requiring authentication. The following scenarios are **not supported**:

- **Sign-in Required**: Meetings that require users to sign in to the platform (Google, Microsoft, Zoom) before joining
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Meetings that require enterprise SSO or domain-specific authentication
- **Password Protected**: Meetings that require a password in addition to the meeting link
- **Waiting Room with Authentication**: Meetings where the waiting room requires user identification or authentication

**Supported Scenarios:**
- ✅ Public meeting links that allow direct join
- ✅ Meetings with waiting rooms that don't require authentication
- ✅ Meetings where the bot can join as a guest/anonymous participant
